3-2-1 Rule:
3 Copies of Data – Maintain three copies of data—the original, and at least two copies.
2 Different Media – Use two different media types for storage. This can help reduce any impact that may be attributable to one specific storage media type. It’s your decision as to which storage medium will contain the original data and which will contain any of the additional copies.
1 Copy Offsite – Keep one copy offsite to prevent the possibility of data loss due to a site-specific failure.
